# Todo APP 
Simple Todo app with ```php```, ```mysql``` without OOP on the first version. 

I made my first experiments on docker lastly and it was a good way to create a dev-env for such a simple app with ```docker compose```. 

to install the app locally make sure you have docker (GUI-APP) open and running on your machine. Then go to the directory and run ```docker compose up```.
